# ðŸŽ® Python Guessing Game

This is my first completed Python project! It's a simple number guessing game where the user has 3 attempts to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 10.

## Features
- Random number generation
- Input validation
- Loop control
- Replay functionality
- Error handling

## Files
- `guessing_game_comparison.py`: Contains both my original version and an optimized version for comparison.

## What I Learned
- How to use `input()` and `int()` safely
- How to use `while` loops and `break`
- How to handle errors with `try` and `except`
- How to structure a replay loop

## Next Steps
- Add score tracking
- Add difficulty levels
- Save scores to a file
